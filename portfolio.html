		  <h1> <center>For my group's 1.1.9 project, we made a house on a grassy field. We made the sky change colors as the sun moved, to show the day progressing and time passing by.  </center></h1>

		  <h1><center> Tetris was my group's 1.2.5 project. We made the shapes fall. You can also rotate the shapes as they fall. When the blocks make a row, the row would disapear and a point would be earned. If the falling blocks get too high, then the game is over.   </center></h1>

	          <h1><center> My group and I worked on our 1.3 Project and made a game called Battle Flight. The user's plane shoots out projectiles that destroys the enemy planes. Every enemy plane destroyed is one point. You die if an enemy plane hits your plane. </center></h1>
